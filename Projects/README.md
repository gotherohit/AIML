<b>This section demonstrates part of my journey in order to master Deep Learning. :books:<br>

Goal of this section is to do projects that covers important aspects of Deep Learning as well as Use Cases where Deep Learning can serve as an useful tool in finding solution to complex problems  :books:</b>
</p>

<h3>For use cases our projects will cover, including but not limited to, below Topic/Areas:  </h3>
<ul>
    <li>Generative use cases</li>
    <li>Classification probelems related to Computer Vision, NLP etc.</li>
    <li>Prediction use cases</li>
    <li>Working with Time Series and Sequential Data</li>
    <li>Reinforcement Learning use cases</li>
</ul>

<h3>Packages like TensorFlow, Pytorch, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas will be majorly used, apart from other packages which will be used as and when required </h3>
