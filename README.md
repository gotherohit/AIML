# Learning AI and ML 

<p style="font-size: 25px;">
<b>This repository is created as a companion to my journey towards Learning/Exploring AIML world</b>
</p>

<p style="font-size: 25px;">
<b>Goal of this repository is to serve as a single source covering wide range of topic required in the ever Expanding AI/ML world.</b>
</p>

<h3><b>This Repository will cover below main topics:</b></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Working with Deep Learning Frameworks like TensorFlow, Pytorch etc.</li><br>
    <li>Data prepration and Pipeline creation.</li><br>
    <li>Replicating Researched Models.</li><br>
    <li>Exploring different usecases </li><br>
    <li>Traditional ML models</li>
</ul>

<h4><p>
Apart from above core topics, We will also cover additonal packages that will be useful while working with AI/ML workflows:<br>
Ex: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn etc.<br>
</p></h4>

<h4><p>
Most of the code will be in Python on Jupyter Notebook. :books:
