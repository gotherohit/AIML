<b>This section demonstrate part of my journey in order to master Deep Learning.<br>
Goal of this section is to replicate already reasearched model, so that we can further our understanding of the subject :books:</b>
</p>


<h3>Below steps will be followed while recreating models, using Tensorflow/keras and Pytorch as our Deep Learning frame work </h3>
<ul>
    <li>Do extensive research on the model architecture we are trying to replicate. Model can be related to Computer Vision, NLP, Time Series etc.</li>
    <li>Create Data pipeline, mostly for this section we will leverage Default dataset provided by frameworks we are using. For ex: Fashion MNIST etc.</li>
    <li>Create model Architecture using our framework.</li>
    <li>Train and Test the model.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional Points:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We will add detailed Note in each section highlighting the important points that we learned/performed, which will help in documenting our understanding.</li> 
    <li>We will most often try creating simpler version to limit computation cost, as models will be trained on local machine.</li> 
    <li>Source refrences will be added at the end for the insipration/adaptation of the code.</li> 
</ul>
